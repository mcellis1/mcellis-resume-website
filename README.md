# Matthew's first resume website

## Description

A website was built to serve as a resume for future coding projects. The links to the websites are functional, and you can access various social media and contact information on the website. It is important to have all of the coding projects in one place so that it is easy for potential employers to see all of the projects, without having to navigate through multiple repositories and links. The resume website solves this issue by providing links to all the coding projects and including contact information in one place.

Building this project implements the CSS taught in Bootcamp class inlcuding media queries to make the page responsive to mobile devices. It was difficult to implement the changing of the elements size to respond to mobile devices because there are two different size of elements when viewed on pc, but the desired outcome was to have the elements all be the same size when on mobile to make it easier for readability. Mobile-first development would probably have been a better way to implement this desired outcome because the class could be assigned to the items to be the same size when viewed on a mobile resolution, and then an id could be assigned to the item desired to be a different size when viewed on pc, and then a media query could be used to assign this id the deisred dimensions when viewed on a screen larger than a phone screen
